Major Decisions:
    - ArrayList has a better access complexity than LinkedList
    - ArrayList prefered over array due to expansion opportunities
    - Arraylist containing linkedlist was not going to be space efficient due to sparse key - value pairs
        - HASHMAP containing linkedlists was therefore implemented
PROJECT STATUS:
    - | DONE | ADD VERTICES TO ArrayList LOOKUP TABLE
    - | DONE | ADD EDGE TO LINKEDLIST
    - | DONE | WRITE "public void addEdge(String, String)" method
